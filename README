The files products.php and _header.php have been updated due to a programming error.

The require_login() function was called in product.php after the inclusion of _header.php. Because _header.php outputs the beginning of the page, the header() call in require_login()'s code that redirects the user causes an error, because you cannot send headers after sending page content.

In some configurations this error would not manifest, as PHP may be set to buffer all of the page contents until the script is fully executed
